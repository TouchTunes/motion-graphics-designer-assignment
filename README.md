## Create an innovative motion graphics design for our partnersüñåÔ∏è
### Guidelines: 

You are tasked to create a one-of-a-kind immersive visual experience for one of our clients: Starbucks, Victoria's Secret, Vans, Nike or Burberry. (Please pick only one)

Your objective is to showcase not only your ability to come up with out-of-the-box insights with little to no directives but most importantly, your understanding of the brand as well as our product. 

You will have 24 hours to create a small mock up involving motion graphics design notions that requires OR would require video editing in the process. 
Graphic tools allowed: Adobe CC tools (After Effect, Premiere, Illustrator, etc.) and use of 3D tools (preferably Cinema 4D). 

Good luck! :)
